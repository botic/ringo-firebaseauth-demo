# RingoJS + Firebase Auth

This repository shows how to use RingoJS and the Java Admin SDK for Firebase Auth.
It uses `JavaEventEmitter` to implement the required Java interfaces for the
async token validation of the SDK.

To resolve all dependencies of the SDK this demo uses grade. Run `./gradlew getDeps`
to download all required JARs into the `/jar` folder.
